# Student Performance Project

## Done by Hamad Sami Alassafi

### Data Science Nanodegree by Udacity

### Introduction

#### In this project I will use student score performance dataset. The dataset has been downloaded from Kaggle, and you can find it in this link <a  href = 'https://www.kaggle.com/adithyabshetty100/student-performance'>dataset</a>

### Files in the repository

- EDA.ipynb: It contains the analysis and coding that written in Python programming language to generate the results that I want to find
- StudentsPerformance.csv: The raw data that I used (before preprocessing)

#### Project Motivation

#### I want to analyze in this project the factors that contribute in positive manner in student performance, and whether it can be measured or not

##### I have used Python programming language, and libraries built on it :

- pandas
- matplotlib
- numpy
- seaborn
- scikit-learn

### Summarized Results

1.  Parents educational background effects in student performance in positive manner, also they tend to take preparation courses more than the students that their parents has lower educational background
2.  Complete preparation courses helps students in increasing their score
3.  Female students has scored greater grades than male students
4.  Race and Ethnicity effects in students grade in positive or negative way
